  <!-- PUT INFO AND IMAGES FOR SECTION 1 BELOW HERE   -->

  <p> Long-term changes in Earth's temperature, weather, and other environmental factors are referred to as climate change. It is mostly brought on by human actions that produce greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Due to the heat that these greenhouse gases trap, the earth's temperature is rising, the ice caps are melting, the sea level is rising, there are more extreme weather events, and ecosystems and biodiversity are being disrupted. Wide-ranging effects of climate change include challenges to the availability of food and water, an increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, and population displacement. </p>
